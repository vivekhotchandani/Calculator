This Java program consists of two classes:

Neighbours: This class contains a method findNearest which takes an array of integers as input and returns the index of the pair of elements with the smallest absolute difference.

Userinput: This class contains the main method which takes user input to create an array of integers and then finds the index of the nearest neighboring pair using the findNearest method from the Neighbours class.

Explanation
Neighbours Class
findNearest method: This method iterates through the array and calculates the absolute difference between each element and its adjacent element. It keeps track of the minimum absolute difference and the index of the pair of elements with the minimum absolute difference. After iterating through the array, it returns the index of the pair of elements with the minimum absolute difference.
Userinput Class
main method: This method initializes a BufferedReader object br to read input from the console and a Scanner object scan to read integers. It prompts the user to enter the number of elements in the array and then prompts the user to enter the elements separated by spaces. It reads the input line and splits it into an array of strings using whitespaces as delimiters. It converts each string to an integer and stores it in the inputarray array. It then calls the findNearest method from the Neighbours class to find the index of the nearest neighboring pair. Finally, it prints the index of the nearest neighboring pair.
